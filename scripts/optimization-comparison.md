# Image Optimization Performance Comparison

## Before Optimization
- **Processing**: Sequential (one image at a time)
- **Caching**: None - processes all images every time
- **Concurrency**: 1 worker
- **Memory management**: No optimization
- **Progress reporting**: Basic console logs
- **Quality settings**: High (avif: 80, webp: 80, jpeg: 85)

### Performance Issues
- 53 images Ã— 12 variants = 636 files generated sequentially
- No incremental builds - rebuilds all images on every run
- High memory usage from Sharp default caching
- No performance metrics or progress indication

## After Optimization

### Key Improvements
1. **Parallel Processing**: Uses CPU cores (2-8 concurrent workers)
2. **Smart Caching**: MD5 hash-based incremental optimization
3. **Memory Management**: Batch processing with Sharp cache disabled
4. **Performance Tuning**: Optimized Sharp settings and quality levels
5. **Progress Reporting**: Real-time stats with ETA and processing rate

### Performance Features
- **Concurrency**: Adaptive based on CPU cores (2-8 workers)
- **Caching**: File hash + modification time checking
- **Batch Processing**: Processes variants in groups of 4 for memory efficiency
- **Quality Optimization**: Reduced quality (avif: 75, webp: 75, jpeg: 80) for better speed
- **Smart Skipping**: Skips unchanged files and existing outputs
- **Metrics**: Processing rate, ETA, and comprehensive statistics

## Expected Performance Gains
- **First Run**: 60-80% faster due to parallel processing
- **Subsequent Runs**: 90%+ faster due to caching (only changed images processed)
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory footprint with batch processing
- **Build Experience**: Real-time progress and performance metrics

## Usage
```bash
# Run image optimization
npm run optimize-images
# or
node scripts/optimize-images.js
```

The script automatically:
- Detects CPU cores and sets optimal concurrency
- Creates cache file at `static/images/optimized/.optimization-cache.json`
- Skips unchanged images on subsequent runs
- Provides detailed performance statistics
